#ScalaRest

This project is part of the Growin Scala Academy. It aims at the familiarization with common tools in the Scala environment:

* Play
* Akka HTTP
* Slick
* Lagom
* Http4s
* Doobie

The Scala Academy participants must implement the traits "Controller" "Service" and "Repository" in the core module using the different tools and compare implementations.

Each participant must fork the project and make PRs to their own branch.
